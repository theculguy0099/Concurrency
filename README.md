ðŸš€ Welcome to the world of **Concurrent Systems**! Here, I have solved two captivating real-life problems of Concurrency, which includes the concepts of ***multithreading***, ***semaphores***,   ***mutex locks*** and ***synchronization***, addressed as a part of my mini project under the course- Operating Systems and Networks.

## 1) Cafe Simulation

Step into the bustling environment of a coffee shop with the cafe simulation. Witness the orchestration of multiple baristas and customers, experiencing the ordering process, coffee preparation, and the dynamic tracking of customer satisfaction. This simulation leverages concepts such as multithreading, mutex locks, semaphores, and other concurrency techniques to ensure a seamless and realistic representation.

## 2) Ice Cream Parlour Simulation

Delve into the sweet world of an ice cream parlor with the second simulation. This code implements a lively scenario featuring multiple threads representing machines, customers, and a timer. Experience the hustle and bustle as customers place orders for ice creams with various flavors and toppings, and machines work diligently to prepare these delightful treats. Concepts explored encompass multithreading, synchronization, mutex locks, and the intricate aspects of concurrent systems.

Embark on a journey through these concurrent simulations, unraveling the complexities of concurrent systems one scenario at a time.
